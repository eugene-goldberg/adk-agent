## Booking a Truck

### Scenario 1: New Customer Booking

**User**: Hi, I need a truck to move some furniture this weekend.

**TruckBuddy**: Hi there! I'd be happy to help you find a truck for moving your furniture this weekend. To get started, I'll need a few details about your move:

1. Where will you need to pick up the furniture from?
2. Where will you be taking it to?
3. What day and time would you prefer?
4. Approximately how many hours do you think you'll need the truck?
5. Will you need assistance with loading and unloading?

**User**: I'm moving from 123 Main St to 456 Oak Ave in Chicago this Saturday around 10 AM. Probably need the truck for about 3 hours. And yes, I'd need help with loading.

**TruckBuddy**: Thanks for providing those details! Let me search for available trucks in Chicago this Saturday (May 11, 2025) at 10:00 AM that offer loading assistance.

- Pickup address: 123 Main St, Chicago
- Destination: 456 Oak Ave, Chicago

- Duration: 3 hours

- With loading/unloading assistance

Is this information correct? Also, could you please briefly describe what furniture you'll be moving? This helps the truck owner prepare appropriately.

**User**: Yes, that's correct. I'm moving a couch, bed, dining table, and about 10 boxes.

**TruckBuddy**: Thank you for confirming. I'll book the 2022 Ford F-150 with loading/unloading assistance for you now.

_[Agent uses interact_with_firestore to create a booking]_

Great news! Your booking has been confirmed. Here's your booking information:

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your booking?

### Scenario 2: Checking Weather Before Booking

**User**: I need to book a truck for moving some electronics next Tuesday, but I'm worried about rain.

**TruckBuddy**: That's a valid concern, especially when moving electronics! Let me check the weather forecast for next Tuesday to help you plan better. Which city will you be moving in?

**User**: Seattle

**TruckBuddy**: I'll check the weather forecast for Seattle next Tuesday for you.

_[Agent uses get_weather to retrieve the forecast]_

I've checked the forecast for Seattle next Tuesday (May 14, 2025), and it shows a 70% chance of rain with periodic showers throughout the day. This could definitely pose a risk when moving electronics.

You have a few options:
1. Consider booking a van or box truck instead of an open pickup, as it would provide better protection from the elements
2. Choose a different day - Wednesday and Thursday of next week are forecast to be dry and partly sunny
3. If you must move on Tuesday, ensure you have waterproof covers and plastic wrapping for your electronics

Would you like to see what enclosed vehicles are available next Tuesday, or would you prefer to look at a different day?

**User**: Let's check availability for Thursday instead.

**TruckBuddy**: Good choice! Let me search for available trucks in Seattle for Thursday, May 16, 2025. Do you have a preferred time and how many hours would you need the truck for? Also, will you need assistance with loading/unloading?

### Scenario 3: Checking Booking Status

**User**: My email is alex.johnson@example.com

## Vehicle Information

### Scenario 5: Asking About Truck Types

**User**: What's the difference between a pickup truck and a box truck?

**TruckBuddy**: Great question! Here's how pickup trucks and box trucks differ:

**Pickup Trucks:**
- Open cargo bed at the back
- Typically smaller, easier to drive and park
- Good for hauling furniture, appliances, and items that don't need protection from weather
- Most can carry 1,500-3,000 lbs of cargo
- Better fuel efficiency
- Lower hourly rates (usually $35-50/hour on our platform)
- Ideal for: Small to medium moves, home improvement projects, yard work

**Box Trucks:**
- Enclosed cargo area (like a large box on wheels)
- Available in various sizes (10-26 feet in length)
- Weather protection for all items
- Higher cargo capacity (3,000-10,000 lbs depending on size)
- Loading ramp for easier loading/unloading
- Higher hourly rates (usually $60-90/hour on our platform)
- Ideal for: Larger moves, multiple rooms of furniture, weather-sensitive items

**When to choose a pickup truck:**
- Moving a few large items
- Short-distance moves
- Budget-conscious
- Items aren't sensitive to weather
- No need for high security

**When to choose a box truck:**
- Moving an entire apartment/house
- Weather protection needed
- Higher security desired
- Need to keep items organized
- Willing to pay more for convenience

Would you like me to recommend which would be better for your specific needs?

## Other Scenarios

### Scenario 6: Explaining the Assistance Option

**User**: What does the assistance option mean exactly?

**TruckBuddy**: Great question! The "assistance option" refers to the truck owner helping you with loading and unloading your items, rather than just providing the vehicle.

Here's what's included when you select assistance:

**What's included:**
- The truck owner will actively help carry items to and from the truck
- Help with arranging items in the truck to maximize space and minimize movement during transit
- Assistance with disassembly/reassembly of basic furniture (like bed frames) if needed
- An extra pair of hands for heavier items like sofas, refrigerators, etc.

**What's NOT included:**
- Professional packing services (boxing up your belongings)
- Moving specialized/high-value items like pianos or safes
- Furniture repair or extensive disassembly
- Furniture assembly that requires specialized tools

**How it's priced:**
Assistance is charged as an additional hourly rate on top of the truck rental cost. For example:
- Truck rental: $45/hour
- Assistance: $25/hour
- Total with assistance: $70/hour

This means if you book for 3 hours, you'd pay:
- Without assistance: $135 total
- With assistance: $210 total

The assistance rate varies by truck owner based on their experience and physical capabilities. Some owners might charge more but may have more experience with handling delicate items.

Would you like me to help you find a truck with assistance for your move?

### Scenario 7: Rating System Explanation

**User**: How does the rating system work?

**TruckBuddy**: The PickupTruck App uses a two-way rating system to maintain quality and trust within our community. Here's how it works:

**Rating Scale:**
- All ratings are on a 5-star scale (1 being poor, 5 being excellent)
- Both customers and truck owners rate each other after a completed booking

**As a Customer:**
- After your booking is completed, you'll be prompted to rate your truck owner
- You can rate based on punctuality, vehicle condition, driving, assistance quality (if selected), and overall experience
- You can also leave a written review to share more details about your experience
- Your ratings help other customers choose reliable truck owners

**For Truck Owners:**
- Truck owners also rate customers on timeliness, communication, and respectfulness
- This helps maintain a respectful community
- Truck owners with consistently high ratings (4.7+ stars) are featured as "Top-Rated" in search results
- Owners with ratings below 3.5 stars receive coaching or may be removed from the platform

**How Ratings Impact You:**
- Maintaining a good rating gives you access to more vehicles
- Some premium or specialty vehicles may require customers to have a minimum rating
- Customers with very low ratings may face account restrictions

**Dispute Process:**
- If you feel you've received an unfair rating, you can request a review
- Our support team examines the circumstances and may adjust ratings if warranted
