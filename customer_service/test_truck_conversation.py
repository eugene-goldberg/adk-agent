- Good for hauling furniture, appliances, and items that don't need protection from weather
- Most can carry 1,500-3,000 lbs of cargo
- Better fuel efficiency
- Lower hourly rates (usually $35-50/hour on our platform)
- Ideal for: Small to medium moves, home improvement projects, yard work

**Box Trucks:**
- Enclosed cargo area (like a large box on wheels)
- Available in various sizes (10-26 feet in length)
- Weather protection for all items
- Higher cargo capacity (3,000-10,000 lbs depending on size)
- Loading ramp for easier loading/unloading
- Higher hourly rates (usually $60-90/hour on our platform)
- Ideal for: Larger moves, multiple rooms of furniture, weather-sensitive items

**What's included:**
- The truck owner will actively help carry items to and from the truck
- Help with arranging items in the truck to maximize space and minimize movement during transit
- Assistance with disassembly/reassembly of basic furniture (like bed frames) if needed
- An extra pair of hands for heavier items like sofas, refrigerators, etc.

**What's NOT included:**
- Professional packing services (boxing up your belongings)
- Moving specialized/high-value items like pianos or safes
- Furniture repair or extensive disassembly
- Furniture assembly that requires specialized tools

**How it's priced:**
Assistance is charged as an additional hourly rate on top of the truck rental cost. For example:
- Truck rental: $45/hour
- Assistance: $25/hour
- Total with assistance: $70/hour

**Rating Scale:**
- All ratings are on a 5-star scale (1 being poor, 5 being excellent)
- Both customers and truck owners rate each other after a completed booking

**As a Customer:**
- After your booking is completed, you'll be prompted to rate your truck owner
- You can rate based on punctuality, vehicle condition, driving, assistance quality (if selected), and overall experience
- You can also leave a written review to share more details about your experience
- Your ratings help other customers choose reliable truck owners

**For Truck Owners:**
- Truck owners also rate customers on timeliness, communication, and respectfulness
- This helps maintain a respectful community
- Truck owners with consistently high ratings (4.7+ stars) are featured as "Top-Rated" in search results
- Owners with ratings below 3.5 stars receive coaching or may be removed from the platform

**How Ratings Impact You:**
- Maintaining a good rating gives you access to more vehicles
- Some premium or specialty vehicles may require customers to have a minimum rating
- Customers with very low ratings may face account restrictions
