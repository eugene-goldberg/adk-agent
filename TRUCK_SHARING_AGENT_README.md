### Active Sessions
- **Session ID**: 3587306768956391424
- **User ID**: test_user

## Verified Capabilities

The following capabilities have been extensively tested and confirmed working:

1. ‚úÖ **Conversational Interface**: The agent can handle natural language conversations about truck bookings, scheduling, and inquiries.
2. ‚úÖ **Firestore Integration**: The agent is fully integrated with the Firestore database, enabling it to:
   - Query existing customer profiles
   - Search for available vehicles based on criteria (type, availability)
   - Create, read, update, and delete bookings
   - Handle complex booking workflows
3. ‚úÖ **Weather Information**: The agent can provide weather forecasts for moving dates to help customers plan.
4. ‚úÖ **End-to-End Booking**: The agent can guide users through the complete booking process, from inquiry to confirmation.

## Live Bookings in Firestore

The agent has been confirmed to successfully create real bookings in the Firestore database. Current test bookings:

1. **booking_1746726299**: Ford F-150, Status: confirmed
2. **booking_1746726517**: Ford F-150, Status: confirmed

These bookings were created through our testing process and demonstrate the agent's ability to interact with the production database.

## Testing the Agent

There are multiple ways to test and interact with the deployed agent:

### 1. Google Cloud Console (Recommended)

The simplest way to test the agent is through the Google Cloud Console:

1. Visit the following URL to access the agent test page:
   [Agent Test Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative/reasoning-engines/details/9202903528392097792/test?project=pickuptruckapp)

2. You can create a new session or use the existing session ID: `3587306768956391424`

3. Example queries to try:
   - "I need a pickup truck to move some furniture from downtown to my new apartment this Saturday."
   - "What's the weather forecast for my move on Saturday?"
   - "Can I find a truck with a covered bed in case it rains?"
   - "How much would it cost to rent a medium-sized truck for 4 hours?"

### 2. Using the Python Test Scripts

We've developed several Python scripts to test different aspects of the agent:

```bash
# Activate the Python environment
cd /Users/eugene/dev/ai/pickuptruckapp/deploy-adk-agent-engine
source venv-py312/bin/activate

# Test conversation scenarios (simulated, doesn't create real bookings)
python customer_service/test_truck_conversation.py --scenario booking
python customer_service/test_truck_conversation.py --scenario weather

# Test Firestore integration (creates test data then cleans it up)
python customer_service/test_truck_firestore.py

# Create a sample booking in Firestore
python create_sample_booking.py

# Run a full conversation that creates a real booking
python interactive_booking_test.py

# Simple CLI tool to get testing links
python simple_test_cli.py "Your message here"
```

### 3. Integration with Mobile App

For integration with the PickupTruck mobile app, you should use the Google Cloud API to interact with the agent through Vertex AI Agent Engine:

```javascript
// Example React Native frontend integration (conceptual)
import { VertexAI } from '@google-cloud/vertexai';

// Initialize the Vertex AI client
const vertexAI = new VertexAI({
  project: 'pickuptruckapp',
  location: 'us-central1',
});

// Get the agent
const agent = vertexAI.getAgent('9202903528392097792');

// Create a session for a specific user
const session = await agent.createSession(userId);

// Send messages to the agent
const response = await agent.sendMessage(sessionId, 'I need a truck for moving this weekend');

// Display the response to the user
// ...
```

## Code Assets

The following code assets are available for integration:

1. **Conversation Tests**: `customer_service/test_truck_conversation.py` - Test different conversation scenarios
2. **Firestore Integration Tests**: `customer_service/test_truck_firestore.py` - Test database interactions
3. **Interactive Booking Test**: `interactive_booking_test.py` - Create real bookings through simulated conversations
4. **Deployment Scripts**: `deployment/truck_sharing_remote.py` - Update and manage the deployed agent

## Integration Guide

To integrate the agent with the PickupTruck mobile app:

1. **Authentication**: Ensure the mobile app has proper authentication with Google Cloud.
2. **Session Management**: Create and maintain sessions for each user.
3. **Message Handling**: Send user messages to the agent and display responses.
4. **Booking Confirmation**: After a booking is created, fetch and display the booking details.
5. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for network issues or agent unavailability.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the agent:

1. **Check Agent Status**: Verify the agent is deployed by visiting the [Reasoning Engines page](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative/reasoning-engines?project=pickuptruckapp).

2. **Session Issues**: If a session becomes unresponsive, create a new one using:
   ```python
   session = agent.create_session(user_id="user_123")
   ```

3. **Database Connection**: If the agent can't access the database, check the Firestore permissions and ensure the service account has proper access.

4. **Log Analysis**: Check the logs in Google Cloud Console for specific error messages.
