## Agent Discovery

First, I attempted to list deployed agents using the provided shell script:

```bash
./list_agents.sh
```

This gave an error because the script was using a different project ID by default (`simple-agent-project`). Looking at the script contents:

```bash
cat list_agents.sh
```

I found that the script defaults to using the `simple-agent-project` for listing agents. However, our current configuration showed:

```bash
gcloud config list project
```

Output:
```
[core]
project = pickuptruckapp
Your active configuration is: [default]
```

I then specified the correct project when running the script:

```bash
./list_agents.sh --project pickuptruckapp
```

Output:
```

Display Name: customer-service-agent
Description: A customer service agent for Cymbal Home & Garden with Firestore and Weather integrations that helps customers with product recommendations, bookings, and gardening advice.
Storage: gs://pickuptruckapp-bucket/agent_engine/agent_engine.pkl
```

This revealed one deployed agent: a Customer Service Agent with ID `1818126039411326976`.

## Creating a Session

To create a session with the agent, I used the Python deployment script:

```bash
python deployment/customer_service_remote.py --create_session --resource_id=projects/843958766652/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/1818126039411326976
```

Output:
```
Using project ID: pickuptruckapp
Using location: us-central1
Using bucket: gs://pickuptruckapp-bucket
Created session:
  Session ID: 7300524661723365376
  User ID: test_user
  App name: 1818126039411326976
  Last update time: 1746715486.527744

Use this session ID with --session_id when sending messages.
INFO:customer_service.firestore_agent.agent:FirestoreAgent initialized with Project ID: pickuptruckapp, Database ID: (default)
DEBUG:google.auth._default:Checking None for explicit credentials as part of auth process...
DEBUG:google.auth._default:Checking Cloud SDK credentials as part of auth process...
INFO:customer_service.firestore_agent.agent:Firestore client initialized successfully.
```

This created a session with ID `7300524661723365376` for testing the agent.

## Basic Interaction Testing

I sent an initial message to test basic functionality:

```bash
python deployment/customer_service_remote.py --send --resource_id=projects/843958766652/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/1818126039411326976 --session_id=7300524661723365376 --message="Hello, I'm looking for recommendations for plants that would do well in a desert climate."
```

The agent responded by:
1. Identifying the user as "Alex" from stored customer data
2. Asking about interest in specific types of plants
3. Noting the garden has full sun exposure (from customer profile)

## Weather Integration Testing

I tested the agent's ability to integrate with the Weather Agent:

```bash
python deployment/customer_service_remote.py --send --resource_id=projects/843958766652/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/1818126039411326976 --session_id=7300524661723365376 --message="I'm interested in both flowers and cacti. What's the weather going to be like in Las Vegas this week, and which plants would be suitable based on the forecast?"
```

The agent:
1. Used the `get_weather` tool to fetch the Las Vegas forecast
2. Received weather data showing sunny conditions with temperatures from 17°C to 35°C
3. Recommended suitable plants based on the weather:
   - Flowers: Zinnia and Gaillardia (Blanket Flower)
   - Cacti: Barrel Cactus and Prickly Pear Cactus
4. Checked the user's cart using `access_cart_information`
5. Found standard potting soil and general-purpose fertilizer in the cart
6. Suggested more appropriate alternatives for desert plants

## Cart Management Testing

I tested the agent's ability to modify the user's cart:

```bash
python deployment/customer_service_remote.py --send --resource_id=projects/843958766652/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/1818126039411326976 --session_id=7300524661723365376 --message="Yes, please replace the standard potting soil with cactus mix and add the bloom-boosting fertilizer. Also, can you create a booking for a planting consultation next Friday at 2pm?"
```

The agent:
1. Used the `modify_cart` tool to update the user's cart:
   - Removed standard potting soil
   - Added bloom booster fertilizer
2. Began the booking process and asked for date confirmation

## Firestore Integration Testing

### Creating a Booking

Testing the booking creation process:

```bash
python deployment/customer_service_remote.py --send --resource_id=projects/843958766652/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/1818126039411326976 --session_id=7300524661723365376 --message="Yes, Friday May 17th at 2pm works for me."
```

The agent:
1. Used `get_available_planting_times` to check availability
2. Found two available time slots: 9-12 and 13-16 (1-4 PM)
3. Asked for confirmation of the afternoon slot

I confirmed the booking:

```bash
python deployment/customer_service_remote.py --send --resource_id=projects/843958766652/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/1818126039411326976 --session_id=7300524661723365376 --message="Yes, the afternoon slot from 1-4 PM works perfect for me."
```

The agent:
1. Used `schedule_planting_service` to create the booking
2. Successfully created the booking with ID `ec01795c-e430-4893-b8ba-29b9ab9e4009`

I requested to store the booking in Firestore and receive care instructions:

```bash
python deployment/customer_service_remote.py --send --resource_id=projects/843958766652/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/1818126039411326976 --session_id=7300524661723365376 --message="Yes, please send me the care instructions. Also, could you store my appointment in the Firestore database?"
```

The agent:
1. Used `send_care_instructions` to send care information for the recommended plants
2. Used `interact_with_firestore` to store the booking with query `write:bookings:ec01795c-e430-4893-b8ba-29b9ab9e4009:{"customer_id":"123","date":"2024-05-17", "time_range":"13-16", "details":"Planting consultation for flowers and cacti"}`
3. Successfully stored the booking in Firestore

### Retrieving a Booking

I tested retrieving the booking from Firestore:

```bash
python deployment/customer_service_remote.py --send --resource_id=projects/843958766652/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/1818126039411326976 --session_id=7300524661723365376 --message="Could you retrieve the appointment details from Firestore and show them to me?"
```

The agent:
1. Used `interact_with_firestore` with query `read:bookings:ec01795c-e430-4893-b8ba-29b9ab9e4009`
2. Successfully retrieved and displayed the booking details:
   - Customer ID: 123
   - Date: 2024-05-17
   - Time Range: 13-16 (1:00 PM - 4:00 PM)
   - Details: Planting consultation for flowers and cacti
   - Appointment ID: ec01795c-e430-4893-b8ba-29b9ab9e4009

### Listing All Bookings

Finally, I tested retrieving all bookings for the customer:

```bash
python deployment/customer_service_remote.py --send --resource_id=projects/843958766652/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/1818126039411326976 --session_id=7300524661723365376 --message="Could you show me all my bookings in the Firestore database?"
```

The agent:
1. Used `interact_with_firestore` with query `query:bookings:{"filters":[{"field":"customer_id","op":"==","value":"123"}]}`
2. Successfully retrieved and listed all bookings:
   - A planting appointment for petunias on May 25, 2025
   - The newly created consultation on May 17, 2024
   - A garden planting service on June 1, 2025
   - A lawn mowing service on July 20, 2025

## Summary

The testing confirmed that the deployed Customer Service Agent has full functionality:

1. **Customer Profile Integration**: Recognizes the customer and accesses their profile information
2. **Weather Integration**: Fetches and analyzes weather data to provide contextual recommendations
3. **Product Recommendations**: Suggests appropriate products based on customer needs and climate
4. **Cart Management**: Views and modifies the customer's shopping cart
5. **Appointment Scheduling**: Checks availability and schedules service appointments
6. **Firestore Integration**: Creates, retrieves, and queries data in the Firestore database
7. **Communication Tools**: Sends care instructions and other information to customers

All functionalities of the Customer Service Agent are operational in the deployed Vertex AI version.
